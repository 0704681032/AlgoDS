1) **Binary Tree Postorder Traversal**
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [3,2,1].
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

2) **Copy List with Random Pointer**
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
Return a deep copy of the list.
