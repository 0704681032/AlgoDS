1)Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

2)Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

3)Delete Node in a Linked List
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

4)Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

5)Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

6)Binary Tree Level Order Traversal I
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
For example:Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

7)Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
For example:Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
8) Invert a binary tree.
