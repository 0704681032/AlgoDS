# Algorithms and Data Structures
This is the collection of **algorithms, data structures** and **Interview Questions** with solutions.
This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in Java.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously.   

Interview Questions package include 3 text files (_1Easy, 2Medium and 3Hard_) and **solutions** for each question.      

**8 Algorithms, 2 Data Structures** and **85 Interview Questions with answers** are provided so far.

##Problems:
  
###Arrays
1) [Rotate Array](https://github.com/sherxon/AlgoDS/blob/master/src/InterviewQuestions/Easy/RotateArray.java)      

##Algorithms
  
###Sorting And Searching:    
1) Bubble Sort  
2) Insertion Sort  
3) Selection Sort  
4) Counting Sort  

###Graphs:  
1) Breadth First Search (BFS)  
2) Depth First Search (DFS)  
3) Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)  
4) KrusKal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)    


##Data Structure:      
###Trees:  
1) Binary Search Tree (recursive, iterative, duplicate support, key-value pair)  
2) AVL Tree
